## Using RMySQL package
The R package **RMySQL** makes it very easy to connect MySQL databases and make the queries. 
```{r}
library(RMySQL)
## Connect to a MySQL database.
con <- dbConnect(MySQL(), user = "root", password = "CloEfk93L7Vmx0z$3",
          dbname = "sampdb", host = "localhost")
## List tables 
dbListTables(con)

## Run a SQL qurey
dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM president LIMIT 5")
```

We can use following SAS code to connect and query the database.
```
proc sql;    
connect to mysql (user=root password=CloEfk93L7Vmx0z$3 server=localhost
        database=sampdbdb port=9876);
select *
   from connection to mysql
     (select * from president);
    disconnect from mysql;
quit;
```
